# 🏥 Healthcare Predictive Analytics: Patient Readmission

## 📌 Introduction

Hospital readmissions within 30 days are not only expensive but often avoidable. This project addresses the challenge of predicting patient readmission by analyzing structured healthcare data and incorporating time-based predictive modeling. It is designed to simulate real-world healthcare analytics challenges, requiring the integration of ethical considerations and operational implications.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* 🔍 **Predict** patient readmission risk within 30 days.
* 🧠 **Identify** key factors contributing to readmissions.
* 📊 **Develop** an interpretable risk scoring system.
* 🧑‍⚕️ **Create** interactive visualizations for medical staff to easily interpret patient risk.
* ⚙️ **Design** a simulator to forecast hospital staffing needs based on predicted readmissions.

## 📂 Dataset

* **Source:** Kaggle - [Diabetes Readmission Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/1056lab-diabetes-readmission-prediction/data?select=train.csv)
* **Description:** Structured medical data including demographics, lab results, diagnoses, and readmission status.

## 🧰 Technologies & Tools

* Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP)
* Jupyter Notebooks
* Streamlit / Dash (for visualization and simulator)
* Plotly / Seaborn / Matplotlib
* External APIs for weather, pollution, and social event data

## 🔐 Ethical Considerations

* Bias in healthcare data
* Fairness in model predictions
* Transparent and interpretable decision-making
* Patient privacy and data anonymization
