# Healthcare Predictive Analytics: Patient Readmission

##  Introduction

Hospital readmissions within 30 days are not only expensive but often avoidable. This project addresses the challenge of predicting patient readmission by analyzing structured healthcare data and incorporating time-based predictive modeling. It is designed to simulate real-world healthcare analytics challenges, requiring the integration of ethical considerations and operational implications.

##  Project Objectives

*  **Predict** patient readmission risk within 30 days.
* **Identify** key factors contributing to readmissions.
*  **Develop** an interpretable risk scoring system.
*  **Create** interactive visualizations for medical staff to easily interpret patient risk.
* **Design** a simulator to forecast hospital staffing needs based on predicted readmissions.

## Dataset

* **Source:** Kaggle - [Diabetes Readmission Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/1056lab-diabetes-readmission-prediction/data?select=train.csv)
* **Description:** Structured medical data including demographics, lab results, diagnoses, and readmission status.

##  Technologies & Tools

* Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, SHAP)
* Colab
* Plotly / Seaborn / Matplotlib

## Ethical Considerations

* Bias in healthcare data
* Fairness in model predictions
* Transparent and interpretable decision-making
* Patient privacy and data anonymization
